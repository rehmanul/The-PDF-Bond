              Okkyno was founded in 2020 by a group of passionate gardeners who wanted to make gardening more accessible to urban dwellers and those with limited outdoor space. We started with a simple blog sharing container gardening tips, which quickly grew into a community of garden enthusiasts.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              As our community grew, we recognized the need for specialized products designed specifically for small-space and urban gardening. With feedback from our community, we developed and curated a collection of tools, soil mixes, seeds, and planters optimized for success in challenging environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Okkyno has evolved into a comprehensive resource for gardeners of all experience levels. We've expanded our product offerings, created in-depth educational content, and built a supportive community where gardeners can share their successes, challenges, and advice.
